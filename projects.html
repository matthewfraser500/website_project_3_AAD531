        <p>Recently I conducted a presentation upon the possible configurations and benefits which PFsense provides as an open-source routing and firewall solution.<br>
        <br>My audience being first year students at NMIT who study information technology. The presentation consisted of the graphical user interface, packet filtering, static routing, black/white listing, Dynamic host control protocol and more.
        <br><br>>In future projects I will be implementing PFsense to futher my knowledge around firewall and routing capabilities it provides.

            <p>Throughout my networking experiences many firewall have been configured and implemented, another being SOPHOS another open-source firewall solution. 
                <br><br>Sophos was implemented upon a Windows Server, high levels of security was crucial though-out the network as we hosted clients data, including many departments whom the employees required different levels of access through-out the network.
                <br><br>Blacklisting was configured to block HTTPS ports, prohibiting specific web domains. Configuration of a VPN was conducted which allows for end-to-end connectivity for employees out in the field, allowing them to remotely connect into our servers should the need arise.
